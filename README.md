# DroidScript RSS Readers

This project is done in <a href="http://droidscript.org/">DroidScript</a> which is a really neat JavaScript IDE that I have been dabbling in lately. It runs directly on your device but you can connect it to your laptop through the WiFi and do the scripting from there.

These are simple RSS readers that pull data from a user-entered URL through XML HTTP requests. The XML then gets processed into HTML and displayed through a WebView.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* First you need the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartphoneremote.androidscriptfree&hl=en">DroidScript - JavaScript Mobile Coding IDE</a> from the Google Playstore. 

### Installing

* From the main page of the application, click on the WiFi Connect button in the toolbar. Follow the instructions to access your local IDE from your browser.

* In the Apps tab, create a new JS application, title it what you will, and copy the code from one of the .js files in this repo into the application.

* Run the application from the browser, which will save the code to your phone and compile it there.

* Customize as you please from there.
